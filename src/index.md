# Transit Access and Equity in Pittsburgh

Public transit is a critical issue in Pittsburgh. Low-income neighborhoods in different areas in the world face issues regarding public transport such as fewer bus stops, longer wait times, and less reliable service compared to other areas. These disparities limit the residents’ access to jobs, education, and essential services. This makes public transport not only a mobility concern but also a matter of social and economic justice. We plan on exploring and understanding the issue in the Pittsburgh area. 

In this dashboard, we will analyze demographic data and spatial patterns to identify areas with high mobility needs and assess how well public transit serves these communities. We have these 3 goals when analyzing the data:
1. Demonstrating the current layout of bus stops, routes, and car usage in Pittsburgh.
2. Portraying the correlation between low income and bus accessibility. Exploring whether bus accessibility is reliable (in terms of bus stop frequency and bus performance) in low income neighborhoods. 
3. Demonstrating the difference in accessibility between various demographics.

We first begin with an exploratory analysis of Pittsburgh's demographics, focusing on disability status, age distribution, and racial composition. Following this, we conduct a spatial analysis using ArcGIS maps to visualize income vulnerability and mobility equity across neighborhoods. Finally, we present persona-based transit timelines to illustrate real-world commuting experiences in different areas of the city.
